**ERD ASSUMPTIONS**:
  - We consider that you can be a super person without being considered a vilian or a hero.
  - We are assuming organizations only have one address.
  - We are assuming that a sighting will have only one location (we are not considering movement between boarders of locations).
  - We are assuming that super powers are so varied that it wouldn't make sense to list/limit them into a table
**ERD NOTES**:
	- Location Name is ___
	- Location Description is ___
DAO NOTES:
   - The ID of the sighting given in the parameter will be ignored.
  
  - For adding a sighting or superperson, the id will be autogenerated
